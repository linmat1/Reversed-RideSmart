now here's the purpose of this app

i'm trying to automatically book lyfts instead of ridesmart vehicles for people

Here's how it works

When someone searches for a ridesmart route, if there aren't enough drivers/vehicles available, it will allow the user to book a lyft for free.

So what this app is trying to do, is, have lots of other people book the same route the initial person is going on, so that there aren't enough vehicles/spaces free,
which means the original booker would then get a lyft.

So there's probably some logic that needs to be implemented for this:

- say person going from A to B is the original person
- search a different person (to check if lyft is already available)
- if yes, search as original person and book the lyft
- if not, search as another different person to check if lyft is available
- continue searching as different people to see if lyft is available
- when a lyft is available, search as original person and book lyft
- (there are probably ways of speeding this up, like, if the 1st non original searcher sees 3 vehicles/rides available, book all 3 with 3 different accounts - remember, one account can only book one ride)
- (but the above shouldn't be implemented yet, it's a bit complicated for now)

- i also need you to make either a front-end or command line interface for this, to track exactly what process of the logic is being executed

remember, if there are any errors in booking or searching (it might be because the account already has a ride booked etc.), just move on to another account
